# SMS plugin

The SMS plugin allows you to interact with Jeedom via SMS. It also allows Jeedom to send you an SMS in the event of an alert (alarm plugin, scenario, etc).

> **Important**
>
> To interact with Jeedom, you must have configured interactions.

# Plugin configuration

After downloading the plugin, just activate it and configure the port. After saving the demon should launch.
The plugin is already configured by default, so you don't have to do anything more. However you can modify this configuration, here is the detail :

- **SMS port** : the USB port on which your GSM key is connected (for example it can be /dev/ttyUSB0, to see it just run `dmesg` then plug in the modem).

> **TRICK**
>
> If you do not know which USB port is used, you can simply indicate "Auto". Please note that the auto mode only works with Huawei E220 keys.

> **Important**
>
> Please note that some 3G keys are in modem mode by default and not GSM. You must, using the software of your key manufacturer, change the mode of the key to GSM (or text, or serial).

- **Communication speed** : recent keys work at 115200 baud. You have the option of switching to 9600 baud in case your equipment requires it.
- **Pin code** : Allows you to indicate the pin code of the SIM card, to leave empty if you do not have one.
- **Text mode** : Extended compatibility mode, to be used only if sending and / or receiving messages does not work.
- **Cut messages by character packet** : Indicates the maximum number of characters per text message.
- **SMS / SMS Gateway (modify in case of error : CMS 330 SMSC number not set)** : Only change if you have the error `CMS 330 SMSC number not set`, in this case you must indicate the SMS gateway number of your telephone operator.
- **Signal strength** : Signal strength of your GSM key.
- **Network** : Telephone network of your GSM key (can be "None" if Jeedom cannot recover it).
- **Internal socket port (dangerous modification)** : allows to modify the internal communication port of the daemon.
- **Cycle (s)** : daemon scan cycle for sending and receiving SMS. Too low a number can lead to instability.

# Equipment configuration

The configuration of SMS devices is accessible from the Plugins → Communication menu.

Here you find all the configuration of your equipment :

- **Equipment name** : name of your SMS equipment.
- **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs.
- **Activate** : makes your equipment active.
- **Visible** : makes your equipment visible on the dashboard.

Below you find some specific parameters:

- **Disable interactions**: allows you to prohibit interactions for all the numbers of this equipment (if you want to prohibit interactions for certain numbers and not for others, you can create several equipment)
- **Allow messages from unknown numbers**: Allows you to accept messages from unknown numbers. The message received as well as the number of the sender will be available via the commands as for any other message. Interactions are always disabled for these numbers
- **Add unknown numbers**: allows you to automatically add the number to the list of orders (therefore to create a new order) when receiving a message from an unknown number

> **WARNING**
>
> This option can be dangerous to use because it will automatically add a corresponding command to the number when receiving a message from an unknown number.
> If on the same equipment you activate interactions, this means that anyone can start interacting with your Jeedom.
> Activate this option only if you are certain to accept this risk.

## The orders

Each device has the following commands:

- **Signal**: gives signal strength;
- **Message**: contains the last sms message received;
- **Sender**: contains the name of the last sender if known, the number otherwise;
- **Send message to**: an action command to send a message to send an sms to a personalized number without having to create the contact command. This allows you to send an sms to a number obtained via an info command from another device under Jeedom for example. Attention, no verification of the number is carried out, you must provide the numbers in international format.

In addition, you can create as many other action commands as desired corresponding to your contacts, for each of them you will have to enter:

- **Name**: the name of the command;
- **User**: corresponding user in Jeedom (allows you to restrict certain interactions to certain users);
- **Number**: phone number to send messages to. You can put several numbers by separating them with `;` (example: `+33612345678;+33698765432`). *Important* : it is necessary to put the numbers in the international format (+33 for France for example).

> **Important**
>
> Only the telephone numbers declared in a device will be able to use the interactions because only they will be authorized.

# Using the plugin

This one is pretty standard in how it works, so you have to add new equipment and then configure:

- The name of it,
- If it is active or not,

Then you have to add the commands which will be composed of a name and a number, only the numbers listed in the list of commands can receive a response from Jeedom (this makes it possible to secure, while avoiding setting a password to each start of an SMS sent to Jeedom). You can also indicate which user is linked to this number (for rights management at interaction level).

To communicate with Jeedom, it will then suffice to send him a message from an authorized number, all interactions coming from the interaction system.

>**EXAMPLE OF INTERACTION** :
>
> - Question : *"What is the temperature of the room ?"*
> - Reply : *"16.3 ° C"*

>Check your USB cable (a bad USB cable often causes this kind of problem, it should not be too long either), also check your power supply, a USB hub is strongly recommended.

>Under jeedom in the SMS plugin, you must (in my case) use the following "SMS port" : ``/dev/ttyUSB3``. Basically you have to try each port to find the right one…

> **The SMS daemon is started, but you do not receive any SMS**
>
>One of the probable causes is the wrong network configuration. In "Settings" → "System" → "Configuration" → "Networks", check the content of the "URL or IP address" field". The latter must not be localhost or 127.0.0.1 but the IP address of your Jeedom or its DNS name.

> **In debug mode I have the error "timeout" which appears**
>
>This error occurs when the key does not respond within 10 seconds of a request. Known causes may be :
>
>- incompatibility of the GSM key,
>- problem with the firmware version of the stick.

> **When starting in debug mode I have : "socket already in use"**
>
>This means that the demon is started but that Jeedom cannot stop it. You can either restart the whole system or in SSH do ``killall -9 refxcmd.py``.

> **The demon refuses to start**
>
>Try to start it in debug mode to see the error.

> **I have several USB ports for my GSM key while I only have one**
>
>This is normal, for some unknown reason the GSM keys create 2 *(see more)* system level USB ports. Just choose one, no matter which one.

> **Jeedom does not send or receive SMS anymore**
>
>This usually happens if the GSM key can no longer connect to the network. Try moving it around to see if it comes back after a few minutes.

>**I have reception concerns that work for a few hours then nothing**
>
>Put the SIM card on a mobile phone and empty all text messages from the card (sent and received).
