# SMS plugin

The SMS plugin allows you to interact with Jeedom via SMS. It also allows Jeedom to send you an SMS in the event of an alert (alarm plugin, scenario, etc).

> **Important**
>
> To interact with Jeedom, you must have configured interactions.

# Plugin configuration

After downloading the plugin, just activate it and configure the port. After saving the demon should launch.    
The plugin is already configured by default, so you don't have to do anything more. However you can modify this configuration, here is the detail :

-   **SMS port** : the USB port on which your GSM key is connected.

> **TRICK**
>
> If you do not know which USB port is used, you can simply indicate "Auto". Please note that the auto mode only works with Huawei E220 keys.

> **Important**
>
> Please note that some 3G keys are in modem mode by default and not GSM. You must, using the software of your key manufacturer, change the mode of the key to GSM (or text, or serial).

-   **Communication speed** : recent keys work at 115200 baud. You have the option of switching to 9600 baud in case your equipment requires it.
-   **Pin code** : Allows you to indicate the pin code of the SIM card, to leave empty if you do not have one.
-   **Text mode** : Extended compatibility mode, to be used only if sending and / or receiving messages does not work.
-   **Cut messages by character packet** : Indicates the maximum number of characters per text message.
-   **SMS / SMS Gateway (modify in case of error : CMS 330 SMSC number not set)** : Only change if you have the error `CMS 330 SMSC number not set`, in this case you must indicate the SMS gateway number of your telephone operator.
-   **Signal strength** : Signal strength of your GSM key.
-   **Network** : Telephone network of your GSM key (can be "None" if Jeedom cannot recover it).
-   **Internal socket port (dangerous modification)** : allows to modify the internal communication port of the daemon.
-   **Cycle (s)** : daemon scan cycle for sending and receiving SMS. Too low a number can lead to instability.

# Equipment configuration

The configuration of SMS devices is accessible from the Plugins → Communication menu.

Here you find all the configuration of your equipment :

-   **SMS equipment name** : name of your SMS equipment.
-   **Activate** : makes your equipment active.
-   **Visible** : makes your equipment visible on the dashboard.
-   **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs.

Below you find the list of orders :

-   **Name** : the name displayed on the dashboard.
-   **User** : corresponding user in Jeedom (allows you to restrict certain interactions to certain users).
-   **Number** : phone number to send messages to. You can put several numbers by separating them with; *(exemple: 0612345678; 0698765432)*. Important : it is necessary to put the numbers in the international format (+33 for France for example)

> **Important**
>
> Only the phone numbers declared in a device can use the interactions because only they will be authorized.

-   **Show** : allows to display the data on the dashboard.
-   **Advanced configuration** (small notched wheels) : displays the advanced configuration of the command (logging method, widget, etc.)).
-   **Test** : Used to test the command.
-   **Delete** (sign -) : allows to delete the command.

# Using the plugin

This is fairly standard in its operation, on the General → Plugin page then by selecting the SMS plugin :

-   The port (path) to the device that serves as a modem (for example it can be / dev / ttyUSB0, to see it just launch ``dmesg`` then plug in the modem)
-   The pin code of the sim card

So you have to add new equipment and then configure it :

-   The name of it,
-   If it is active or not,

Then you have to add the commands which will be composed of a name and a number, only the numbers listed in the list of commands can receive a response from Jeedom (this makes it possible to secure, while avoiding setting a password to each start of an SMS sent to Jeedom). You can also indicate which user is linked to this number (for rights management at interaction level).

To communicate with Jeedom, it will then suffice to send him a message from an authorized number, all interactions coming from the interaction system.

>**EXAMPLE OF INTERACTION** :
>
> - Question : *"What is the temperature of the room ?"*
> - Reply : *"16.3 ° C"*

> **I can't see the USB port on my key**

>Make sure you don't have brltty installed (`sudo apt-get remove brltty` to remove it).

> **After a few hours / days I no longer receive an SMS and can no longer send one, a reminder from the demon corrects**

>Check your USB cable (a bad USB cable often causes this kind of problem, it should not be too long either), also check your power supply, a USB hub is strongly recommended.

>Under jeedom in the SMS plugin, you must (in my case) use the following "SMS port" : ``/dev/ttyUSB3``. Basically you have to try each port to find the right one…

> **The SMS daemon is started, but you do not receive any SMS**
>
>One of the probable causes is the wrong network configuration. In "Settings" → "System" → "Configuration" → "Networks", check the content of the "URL or IP address" field". The latter must not be localhost or 127.0.0.1 but the IP address of your Jeedom or its DNS name.

> **In debug mode I have the error "timeout" which appears**
>
>This error occurs when the key does not respond within 10 seconds of a request. Known causes may be :
>
>-   incompatibility of the GSM key,
>-   problem with the firmware version of the stick.

> **When starting in debug mode I have : "socket already in use"**
>
>This means that the demon is started but that Jeedom cannot stop it. You can either restart the whole system or in SSH do ``killall -9 refxcmd.py``.

> **The demon refuses to start**
>
>Try to start it in debug mode to see the error.

> **I have several USB ports for my GSM key while I only have one**
>
>This is normal, for some unknown reason the GSM keys create 2 *(see more)* system level USB ports. Just choose one, no matter which one.

> **Jeedom does not send or receive SMS anymore**
>
>This usually happens if the GSM key can no longer connect to the network. Try moving it around to see if it comes back after a few minutes.

>**I have reception concerns that work for a few hours then nothing**
>
>Put the SIM card on a mobile phone and empty all text messages from the card (sent and received).
